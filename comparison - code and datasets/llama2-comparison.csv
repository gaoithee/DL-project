886,"When Riding Facing Backwards, how does steering work?",Turn to the opposite direction.,"
 Unterscheidung between a motorcycle and a bicycle.

Answer:
Steering on a motorcycle facing backwards is different from a bicycle because the handlebars are not directly connected to the front wheel. Instead, the handlebars are connected to a steering shaft that runs through the frame of the motorcycle, which allows for more precise control over the direction of the vehicle.

On a motorcycle, the front wheel is suspended from the frame by a set"," In the Harry Potter universe, when riding backwards, steering works differently than when riding forwards. On a flying motorcycle, such as the one Hagrid is piloting during their escape from the Death Eaters, the steering mechanism is located on the sidecar rather than the main bike.
